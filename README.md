# OneStepp
 Final year project

This is a webiste that I created using the Univesities resource to render and serve the application in which I have enabled people to used and manipulate 
Information and plan a wedding application depending on the users needs. For which there are certain actions that can be done by the spouses of the application and planners that have agreed to help plan a wedding and making adjustments on certain decisions.
